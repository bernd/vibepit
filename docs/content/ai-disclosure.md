# AI Disclosure

Vibepit uses AI coding agents to assist with planning, code, tests, and
documentation.

We review all AI-assisted changes before merge. A change is accepted only after
tests pass and we verify the behavior. AI output can be incorrect, so we remain
responsible for all released code and documentation.

If you find a bug or inaccuracy, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/bernd/vibepit/issues).
